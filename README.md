# BTS Contribution Visualization
A visualization of each member's contribution to the group's work.

[Viewable by clicking here](https://sandraalsayar.github.io/bts-contribution-vis/)

## Data
Data was gathered by team lead Sandra. Production credits came from the KOMCA online database.

The original format of this data was an Excel spreadsheet. In order to use this data with d3.js, we converted it into a .csv format and then used an online converter that transformed it into JSON. 

## Contribution Types
Contribution within this visualization is classified into four categories: 
1. Voice
2. Write
3. Compose
4. Produce

The type of contribution considered is relative to how much a member himself can contribute. If a member contributes to a song only by voice, that member has 25% contribution.
